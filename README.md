# Library-System-Linked-List

This is first assignment of data structure course (Jan Semester 2021). 

In this project, we need to develop a program that will store and manage Faculty of Information and Communication Technology (FICT) student information and the books they borrow from library using linked list. Three classes have been created which are LibStudent class, LibBook class and Date class. LibStudent class is used to store student information and the book they borrow from library. LibBook class is used to store information for a library book. Lastly, the Date struct is used to store date information.

From this assignment, it help me to review and strengthen concepts about linked lists through an application development  Also, I can review techniques of dynamic data structure creation and manipulation.
